## Build and run on local machine

### Build the application

We are using the `package` goal of the `org.wildfly.plugins:wildfly-maven-plugin` to provision WildFly and deploy the WAR on it.

You can build the application:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean package
----

At the end of the Maven execution, the application (composed of WildFly and the WAR) has been created put in the `target/server` directory.

### Run the application

You can run the application with:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./target/server/bin/standalone.sh
...

Once the application is started, we can query it with:
